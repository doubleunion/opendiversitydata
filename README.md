OpenDiversityData.org 
=================

A list of companies (with a focus on Silicon Valley) and whether or not they publish data about employee demographics and diversity.

## The Goal

The goal is to have a website with a comprehensive list of companies which publish employee diversity data and demographics, with links to where that data can be found.

This data can be useful to decide on where one might want to work, and to encourage companies which do not publish that data to do so.
